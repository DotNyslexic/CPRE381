# CPRE381
In this course I created a simple computer processor. The early labs help to prepare us for when we would be implementing both a single-cycle and a pipelined processor. Pretty much all the labs required us to use VHDL to represent logical operations. A lot of the labs have the test bench outputs included to verify functionality.

###### Lab 1
We didn't really make anything in this lab. Just used files created by our instructor to get oriented to ModelSim.

###### Lab 2
Create a unit to take the one's complement of a number. Also create a two to one MUX. Create a functional full adder. Lastly, create a Fully functioning adder/subtractor arithmetic logic unit (ALU).
