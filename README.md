# CPRE381
In this course I created a simple computer processor. The early labs help to prepare us for when we would be implementing both a single-cycle and a pipelined processor. Pretty much all the labs required us to use VHDL to represent logical operations. A lot of the labs have the test bench outputs included to verify functionality.

###### Lab 1
We didn't really make anything in this lab. Just used files created by our instructor to get oriented to ModelSim.

###### Lab 2
Create a unit to take the one's complement of a number. Also create a two to one MUX. Create a functional full adder. Lastly, create a Fully functioning adder/subtractor arithmetic logic unit (ALU).

###### Lab 3
Begin working with stored (register) values. Create a decoder and a MUX for the Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages (MIPS) application. Finally, implement MIPS application that is capable of adding/subtracting values in addition to storing them.

###### Lab 4
Use the previously created MIPS app, but now store the calculated values in memory (RAM). Also create a signed number extender so components can communicate if they are not working with the same width bus.
